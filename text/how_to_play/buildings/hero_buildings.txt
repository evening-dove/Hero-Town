A Hero Building is a building which is tailored towards a specific hero. Once it is completed, this building will increase the amount of Favour earned each turn with its specified Hero, as well as increase the maximum amount of Favour a player can have with them. | All Hero buildings are locked at the beginning of the game, and to unlock them, the player must have a Garden in their town. The Garden is the Level 1 favor building.
