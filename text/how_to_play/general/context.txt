In the game you play as a Town during the Fantasy-Medieval period. Unfortunately, your Town is relatively defenceless and the only way to protect yourself is by befriending one of the 7 Wandering Heroes, so that they will protect you from all the monsters in the world. Unfortunately you are not the only Town in your area, so you must compete with one another in order to gain as much Favour as you can, in hopes that you will become the Town they most want to protect.
