In a world filled with monster, the only way to defend your people is to align yourself with the 7 Wandering Heroes. | | Construct Buildings, hold Caterings, and maintain a happy community to befriend a Hero. | Heroes all have different things that they find appealing. | For more information about a specific Hero, please consult the Heroes tab above, and click on a Hero’s class to view more about them. | | During the game, Heroes will wander from Town to Town mostly at random, though they are more likely to visit a Town that they like. If a Hero does visit your Town, you will gain a slight Favor boost with them. However, if a Hero does not visit your Town for an extended period of time, there is no way to guarantee the safety of your people. | For more information about penalties involving a Hero not visiting, please consult the Heroes tab above, then click on the Hero Quests sub-heading. |
