Hero Town is a Turn Based Strategy Game with elements of City Management. | | In order to survive, Towns must construct Buildings that will increase their stats, and make them more likely to be liked by the heroes. | | To select a Building for construction, click the Hammer in the bottom left corner of the screen. This will open up a menu with several expandable tabs. Within these tabs there are Buildings. Different Buildings have different effects, and some require a condition to be met in order to begin construction on them. Buildings take several Turns to complete. For more information, please consult the Buildings tab above. | | Once all your decisions have been made, click on the Next Turn button in the bottom right corner of the screen.
